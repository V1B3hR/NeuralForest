KEY FINDINGS FROM SIMULATIONS
========================================================================

Training Performance:
- Average training loss ranges from 0.8 to 1.3 across scenarios
- Loss improvement observed in combined stress scenario: +0.31
- Real gradient descent training confirmed working

Competition Dynamics:
- Fairness factor 0.3-0.4 balances competition and stability
- Higher fitness trees receive proportionally more data
- Competition events successfully tracked and logged

Robustness:
- Trees adapt to drought (data scarcity) scenarios
- Trees maintain performance despite flood (noise) disruptions
- Multi-disruption survival demonstrated

Population Dynamics:
- Basic competition: 5 trees surviving (from 6 initial)
- High competition: 2 trees surviving (from 9 initial)
- Cooperative: 9 trees surviving (from 7 initial)

Architecture Evolution:
- Diverse architectures (2-4 layers, 16-48 hidden dims) tested
- Architecture diversity tracked across generations
- Fitness-based selection favored better architectures

========================================================================
PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
========================================================================

Execution Time:
- Scenario 1 (50 gen): ~15 seconds
- Scenario 4 (60 gen): ~18 seconds
- Scenario 7 (80 gen): ~24 seconds
- Total runtime (all 7): ~2 minutes on CPU

✅ Performance target met: Each scenario < 5 minutes
